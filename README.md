# QuizOnline Quiz Application

This project was an assignment from my HND in Web and Mobile Development at Glasgow Clyde College.

## Project Brief

The goal of this project was to create a quiz application with various quizzes consisting of educational questions and multiple choice answers. It may feature a login system and keep track of the user's progress in each quiz.
I added a personalised header for every user that displays their username when they log in.

## Hosting

You should now be able to access the live app at https://zoej2020.github.io/QuizOnline/ .

## Tech Stack Used

- **JavaScript** - For quiz functionality and keeping track of the user's progress.
- **HTML** - For creating pages and interactive elements.
- **CSS** + **Bootstrap** - For responsive design and customization of Bootstrap classes.
